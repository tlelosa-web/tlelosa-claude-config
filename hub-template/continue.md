description: Resume work at this hub root — reconciles stale sessions, checks for a shared-core update, and reports last-completed/next-pending state from docs/todo.md and docs/session-log.md

## Step 0 — Rename Stale Sessions

Before orienting, clean up titles left over from prior `/continue` runs:

1. Call `list_sessions` (this always excludes the current session, so it's
   safe to run — it can only surface *other* sessions).
2. For every other session still titled exactly `Continuation`, read its
   transcript with `list_events` (most recent 30 first; page backward with
   `before_uuid` if the actual task isn't visible yet) to find the concrete
   task it worked on — the first real user request after the `/continue`
   resume boilerplate, and what got built/fixed/decided.
3. Rename each one with `set_session_title` to `Cont-"<3-6 word
   context-based title>"` — describe what the session actually did, e.g.
   `Cont-"SOPS dashboard & BOM UI fixes batch"`, not the generic bootstrap
   exchange.
4. Skip a session if it has no real task yet (just the `/continue`
   resume-report exchange, no follow-up from Tebello) — leave it as
   `Continuation` until there's something to summarize.
5. **This session's own title is out of reach from inside itself** —
   `set_session_title` can only target other sessions. This session stays
   labeled `Continuation` until a *later* `/continue` run (in a different
   session) renames it per the steps above, or it's renamed manually.

Then proceed to Step 0.5.

## Step 0.5 — Detect Superseded Sessions (ADR-005)

Check for sessions whose task has clearly been completed or made obsolete by
later work on the same project, and propose archiving them:

1. Group the `list_sessions` results (already fetched in Step 0) by `cwd`
   (project folder).
2. For any project folder with more than one open session, read enough of
   each *older* session's transcript with `list_events` (and that project's
   own `docs/todo.md` if it has one) to judge — don't assume — whether its
   task is actually done, merged, or superseded by a later session's work.
   Sessions on genuinely separate, still-relevant tasks (e.g. different
   batches/features in the same project) are **not** candidates just
   because a newer session exists — verified against this hub's own
   session list, where `2. SOPS` routinely has several legitimately
   parallel sessions open at once.
3. For each session judged superseded, propose it to Tebello by name/title
   with a one-line reason (e.g. "`Cont-\"Batch 25 resume: Edit Item
   modals\"` — that PR merged in a later session, this one's task is done").
4. **Never call `archive_session` speculatively.** Only archive a session
   Tebello has explicitly confirmed in this turn, one at a time.
5. If nothing looks superseded, say so briefly and move on — this step
   should not turn into an interrogation when the session list is clean.

Then proceed to Step 1.

## Step 1 — Orient

Read:
- `docs/todo.md` → current hub task queue and priorities
- `docs/session-log.md` → last session summary (final entry only)

## Step 1.5 — Shared Core Update Check (ADR-007)

Check whether the shared `CORE.md` (DCOE architecture, sub-agent roster,
model routing, universal hard rules — see the read instruction near the top
of this hub's `CLAUDE.md`) has upstream changes not yet pulled on this
machine:

```
git -C ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/tlelosa-claude-config fetch --quiet
git -C ~/.claude/plugins/marketplaces/tlelosa-claude-config rev-list HEAD..origin/main --count
```

If the count is > 0, mention it in the Step 3 resume report: "Shared core
template has N new commit(s) upstream — run `/plugin marketplace update
tlelosa-claude-config` to pull them in." This is a signal only — never run
the update automatically, and don't let it block orienting or reporting.
If the marketplace clone doesn't exist on this machine at all, note that
plainly too rather than silently skipping the check.

## Step 2 — Identify Scope

Is the next task:
- **Hub-level** (cross-project, or new work at root) → this `CLAUDE.md`
  governs.
- **Inside a specific project folder** → check whether that folder has its
  own `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`. If it does, read it — it takes precedence
  over this file for anything inside that folder. If it doesn't, this hub
  brain's Hard Rules still apply, but stack-specific conventions must be
  confirmed with Tebello (Domain agent territory) rather than assumed.

## Step 3 — Report State

Tell Tebello:
1. **Last completed task** — from `session-log.md`
2. **Next pending task** — from `todo.md`, with which project (if any) it
   touches
3. **Spec status** — does a spec exist in `docs/specs/` (or the project's
   own `docs/specs/`) for the next task, if it's a build task?
4. **Known risks** — surface the OneDrive/git item from `CLAUDE.md` if
   still unresolved
5. **Blockers** — anything unresolved, pending decisions, or missing
   context

Format:

```
## Session Resume

**Scope:** [Hub-level | <project folder name>]
**Last completed:** [task name]
**Next task:** [task name from todo.md]
**Spec:** [exists at docs/specs/<name>.md | MISSING — must write spec before building | N/A]
**Known risks:** [none new | OneDrive/git fix still pending, see docs/todo.md]
**Blockers:** [none | description]

Ready to proceed? Confirm and I'll start.
```

**Then always follow the prose block with a selectable list** via
`AskUserQuestion` (single question, single-select unless the items are
clearly independent) — do not leave Tebello to respond in free text only.
Build the option list from every open item surfaced in this step: the
`todo.md` "Next task," plus any other still-open items mentioned in the
report (cross-project backlog items, a session flagged as possibly
duplicating work, etc.). Each option is one concrete item with a short
description of what picking it means. This was requested twice
independently (2026-07-17, two separate sessions) — treat it as a standing
preference, not a one-off.

## Step 4 — Wait for Confirmation

Do not begin implementation. Do not open files outside of the reads above.
Wait for Tebello to confirm the task or redirect.

## Spec Gate Reminder

If the next task is a build task and no spec exists → surface this
immediately. Spec must be written and confirmed before any executor is
dispatched.
